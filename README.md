# landing-page

New Skills I Applied:
- Basic CSS
- Flexbox
- Rounding Corners
- Using special characters (eg. copyright)
- Working on a larger project section by section
- Image credits

Next Steps:
I rarely used the flex:_ property and it would be helpful to use it more frequently to ensure that my page's elements resize according to the screen size.
